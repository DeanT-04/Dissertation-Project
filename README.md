## Welcome to Urban Verdure 🌱

Imagine growing fresh herbs, leafy greens, or even strawberries — right inside your flat, with **zero soil**, **minimal water**, and **intelligent automation** doing all the heavy lifting. *Urban Verdure* is a modern take on urban agriculture, designed from the ground up for city dwellers with limited space and time. This project blends engineering precision with sustainability, creating a smart plant cultivator that learns from your plants, optimises their environment, and makes growing food as easy as plugging in a lamp. Whether you're a robotics student, urban gardener, or tech enthusiast, you're about to explore a project that sits at the crossroads of IoT, CAD design, electronics, and future-focused living.
